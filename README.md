# Overview

This repo contains the sample code for the Labcamp: 

It implements a WebSockets client-server system that lets two people play
connect4 against each other

# Usage

`run dev`

This will run both the server and the client. It will also open one web browser on http://localhost:3000. This will the Red player. You need to open another tab (or browser) and go to http://localhost:3000 again. This will be the Yellow player and then the game can start with the players alternating turns until one wins.
